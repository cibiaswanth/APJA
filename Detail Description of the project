3. Past Usage:

  The full dataset was described and analyzed in:

  S. Moro, R. Laureano and P. Cortez. Using Data Mining for Bank Direct Marketing: An Application of the CRISP-DM Methodology. 
  In P. Novais et al. (Eds.), Proceedings of the European Simulation and Modelling Conference - ESM'2011, pp. 117-121, Guimarães, 
  Portugal, October, 2011. EUROSIS.

4. Relevant Information:

   The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. 
   The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, 
   in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. 

   There are two datasets: 
      1) Dis2.csv with all examples, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010).
      2) Dis2.csv with 10% of the examples (4521), randomly selected from bank-full.csv.
   The smallest dataset is provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g. SVM).

   The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable Term_deposit).

5. Number of Instances: 4522 for Dis2.csv 

6. Number of Attributes: 16.
