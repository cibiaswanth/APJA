# APJA Bank Customer churn

Objective: This project is to build a prediction model for customer churn in the banking sector. In the modern world, there is massive competition in the banking sector to hold customers or keep them subscribed to their bank. Machine learning techniques are deployed to build models to predict whether a product would be subscribed by a customer, i.e., the target variable is Term_Deposit. The documentation extensively covers the modeling process, right from feature selection to assessment of the model and calculation of performance metrics. The data narrates the features captured during a telephonic-directed market campaign. There was a pressing need to shift from making multiple contacts to a customer to increase the success rates with fewer efficient contacts. The function of the binary classifier model is to accurately predict the outcome of the target value that signifies the goal defined.
